    <li><b>Fix:</b> The <b>Save All Tabs As</b> menu command did not work, even
     though it was possible to save all tabs using the <b>Save Tabs As</b>
     command.</li>

     some web pages with the error message "TypeError: extractedURI is

  <h2>Changelog for version 0.16</h2>

     for details.</li>
    <li>New preference to use the page title instead of the default suggested
     file name in the "Save As" dialog. Enabling this preference provides
     functionality comparable to the
     <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/834">File Title</a> and
     <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/712">Title Save</a>

    <li>The order of the tabs is now preserved when opening and saving
     multi-page MAFF archives.</li>

    <li>MHTML files couldn't be created properly when the browser operated in
     some languages other than English.<li>
    <li>In the multiple tab selection dialog, occasionally it was not possible

         other content.</li>
        <li>Improved reliability in handling references to images or other
         content.</li>
        <li>Errors that occur while downloading the main file are now
         reported correctly.</li>
        <li>Pages that are contained in an archive are now saved correctly.</li>
        <li>When the save operation fails, an empty file isn't created anymore
         in place of the target file.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes from 0.16.3 to 0.16.4</h3>

  <h3>Changes from 0.16.0 to 0.16.2</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>New:</b> Preference to use the page title instead of the default
     suggested file name in the "Save As" dialog.</li>
    <li><b>New:</b> The order of the tabs is now preserved when opening and
     saving multi-page MAFF archives.</li>
    <li><b>Change:</b> Now the character set specified in MAFF archives is
     always enforced, and a different character set cannot be selected.</li>
    <li><b>Change:</b> Now the Save Complete component is faster when saving
     pages containing many images or other content.</li>
    <li><b>Change:</b> Now the Save Complete component does not save the main
     document twice, even if it is referenced by the saved files.</li>
    <li><b>Change:</b> Now the Saved Pages Conversion Wizard doesn't execute
     JavaScript or plugins before converting saved pages, since that may slow

  <h2>Changelog for version 0.15</h2>
  <h3>What was new in version 0.15?</h3>
  <p>MAF 0.15.1 had the following user-visible improvements over MAF 0.14.3:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An icon in the address bar or in the status bar provides quick access to
     the original location from which an archived page was saved, as well as the
     date of the save operation.</li>
    <li>In the "Save As" dialog on Windows, the default file extension is now
     omitted from the suggested file name when saving. In most cases, this
     prevents double extensions from appearing in the names of the saved
     archives.</li>
    <li>It is now possible to configure MAF to open MAFF archives without
     extracting their contents to the temporary directory, thus obtaining a
     significant speed gain.</li>
    <li>Now the <b>Preferences</b> menu items and button bring the dialog to
     front if it is already open.</li>
    <li>In the file selection dialog of the <b>Save In Archive</b> commands, now
     the default extension for "All Files" is set appropriately on Windows.</li>
    <li>An error occurred when opening for the first time any archived page with
     no information on the original location the page was saved from.</li>
    <li>Improvements to the integrated
     <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4723">Save Complete</a>
     extension:
      <ul>
        <li>When saving a complete web page outside of an archive, now the name
         of the directory containing the additional files is properly
         localized.</li>
        <li>Now the length of the names of the additional saved files is limited
         to 50 characters, to prevent problems when saving or when extracting
         archives on some file systems.</li>
        <li>Now pages are saved as they appear, without fetching them again from
         the server, in all the cases where it is possible. This may speed up
         saving web pages with highly dynamic content.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Changes from 0.15.0 to 0.15.1</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Change:</b> Audio and video files in OGG containers are not
     re-compressed when archived, in order to provide faster access when opening
     the media files directly from the archive.</li>
    <li><b>Change:</b> If the "jar:" protocol is used to access the contents of
     MAFF archives, the archived files are not extracted to the temporary
     directory anymore, thus obtaining a significant speed gain.</li>
    <li><b>Change:</b> The integrated Save Complete component now saves pages as
     they appear, without fetching them again from the server, in all the cases
     where it is possible.</li>
    <li><b>Fix:</b> The <b>Open in Tabs</b> buttons in the <i>Archives</i>
     dialog could be enabled even if there were no addresses to open.</li>
