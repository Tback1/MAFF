  <h2 class="page-header">Developing with Mozilla Archive Format</h2>

<p>This document is a <b>reference for add-on developers</b>, describing the
 services that Mozilla Archive Format offers to other extensions installed on
 the same user profile. Services available to other extensions include web
 archive creation and extraction, metadata handling, and integration with user
 interface enhancements, like the ability to add file types to the save
 dialogs.</p>

<h3>Supporting the MAFF file format</h3>

<p>If you want to enable your application to use the
 <a href="maff-file-format.html">MAFF file format</a>, the MAF project provides
 support in two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>For Mozilla extensions</b></p>
    <p>If you are working on a Mozilla extension and would like to add web
     archive support, including MAFF and MHTML, it is advisable to use the
     services of Mozilla Archive Format, rather than writing a custom
     implementation. This is also the easiest way to get bugfixes as new
     versions of MAF are released.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, since most of the <a href="source.html">source code</a> of
     MAF is available under a <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/">MPL 1.1+,
     GPL 2.0+, LGPL 2.1+</a> disjunctive tri-license, you can integrate it with
     other extensions released under a compatible license.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>For other applications</b></p>
    <p>If you want to add support for the MAFF file format to other applications, the
     <a href="maff-specification.html">MAFF specification</a> provides some of
     the required technical information. The specification does not depend on a
     specific programming language or Mozilla-based technology.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Feedback and updates</h2>
<p>The Mozilla Archive Format interfaces described in this document are not
 finalized, and are likely to change as new versions are published. Extensions
 that use these APIs will need to be updated from time to time to reflect those
 changes. How often depends on the <a href="#stability">stability levels</a> of
 the referenced APIs.</p>  
<p>All of the internal MAF objects are available to other extensions, but only
 the methods marked as <a href="#status-public">public</a> in this API reference
 are actually checked for backwards compatibility. If you plan to use other
 methods in your extension, please <a href="feedback.html">get in touch</a> and
 those methods will be added to the list of public methods.</p>
<p>Relevant changes in the interfaces of public methods will be announced on the
 <b>MAF mailing list</b>. If you would like to be notified of updates, please
 see the <a href="feedback.html">feedback page</a> for information on how to
 subscribe and send messages to the mailing list.</p>

<h3>Compatible extensions</h3>
<p>Some extensions, like
 <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4838">Multiple Tab
 Handler</a>, are particularly suited to work together with the Mozilla Archive
 Format user experience. If you think your extension is in this category, or if
 your extension makes use of the MAF services, feel free to write to the <b>MAF
 mailing list</b>. Your extension will be taken into consideration for inclusion
 into the list of <a href="documentation.html#extensions">compatible
 extensions</a>.</p>
<p>Compatible extensions are tested periodically with the latest version of MAF,
 in the areas in which they actually work together. For example, the
 <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/8051">UnMHT</a> extension
 makes use of the services to add file types to the "Save As" dialog, and
 includes its own copy of the file type identification and MHTML encoding
 routines of MAF. Considering that the encoding routines work separately, the
 areas subject to testing are save integration and MHTML file opening.</p>

<h2><a name="stability"></a>Stability levels</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b><a name="status-internal"></a>Internal</b></p>
    <p>Internal methods of the MAF objects are always available to other
     extensions installed in the same user profile as MAF, but may change
     without notice.</p>
    <p>All the methods that aren't listed in the API documentation are
     considered internal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b><a name="status-public"></a></a>Public</b></p>
    <p>Public methods and techniques are designed for use by other extensions.
     Changes to the interfaces of these methods will be announced on the <b>MAF
     mailing list</b> and will appear in the
     <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b><a name="status-unstable"></a>Unstable</b></p>
        <p>Unstable public methods and techniques are likely to change in future
         versions of MAF. Changes will typically appear in new minor versions,
         and will be available in experimental releases first.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b><a name="status-stable"></a>Stable</b></p>
        <p>Stable public methods and techniques will not change very often. If
         support for a stable method is dropped, this will be announced some
         time before the support is actually removed. This will typically happen
         only when a new major version is released.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>API documentation</h2>

<h3>Accessing the internal MAF objects</h3>
<p>You can access the MAF JavaScript module using the following technique:</p>
<p>[API status: <a href="#status-unstable">public unstable</a>]</p>
<pre class="code"><code>// Import the Mozilla Archive Format objects
var MafObjects = {};
try {
  Components.utils.import("resource://maf/modules/mafObjects.jsm", MafObjects);
} catch (e) {
  // If MAF is not installed, an exception is thrown.
  // You may want to check for a more specialized exception type here.
}</code></pre>
<p>You can then access the MAF objects using the <tt>MafObjects</tt> variable.
 For example:</p>
<p>[API status: <a href="#status-internal">internal</a>]</p>
<pre class="code"><code>// Create a new object
var exampleObject = new MafObjects.MaffArchive();

// Use a method from a singleton object
var exampleMethodResult = MafObjects.MimeSupport.encodeQuotedPrintable("a=b");</code></pre>

<h3>Adding a new file type to the save dialog</h3>
<p>You can add a file type to the standard "Save As" dialog of Firefox or
 SeaMonkey using the following technique:</p>
<p>[API status: <a href="#status-unstable">public unstable</a>]</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create an overlay for
     <tt>chrome://maf/content/integration/mafCommandsOverlay.xul</tt>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add code similar to the following:</p>
    <pre class="code"><code>// Create the new save behavior object
var newSaveBehavior = new InternalSaveBehavior();
newSaveBehavior.getFileFilter = function(aContentType, aFileExtension) {
  // Return the required values
  return {title: "Display name", extensionstring: "*.ext;*.otherext"};
}
newSaveBehavior.mandatoryExtension = true;
newSaveBehavior.isValidForSaveMode = function(aSaveMode) {
  // aSaveMode is a bitmask. Return true if the filter must be
  // displayed. Display it only if the file is a type that can
  // be saved in an archive.
  return aSaveMode &amp; SAVEMODE_MAFARCHIVE;
}
newSaveBehavior.isComplete = true;
newSaveBehavior.getPersistObject = function(aSaveBrowsers) {
  // saveBrowsers is an array of browser objects
  return new MyPersistObject(aSaveBrowsers);
}

// Add the save behavior to the browser, before the one already
//  present at index 2, assuming it is the one for saving as
//  text only.
gInternalSaveBehaviors.splice(2, 0, newSaveBehavior);</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Implement the <tt>nsIWebBrowserPersist</tt> XPCOM interface in
     <tt>MyPersistObject</tt>. You can find an example of a JavaScript
     implementation in the
     <a href="http://hg.mozdev.org/maf/file/c31112db19e5/src/chrome/content/saving/mafArchivePersistObject.js">MAF
     source code</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
