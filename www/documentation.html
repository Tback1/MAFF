<h3>MAF preferences</h3>
<p>The default settings in effect when you install MAF for the first time
 should be enough to allow correct loading and saving of MAFF and MHTML files.
 To customize advanced aspects of page loading and archiving, the extension's
 preferences dialog can be accessed from the <b>Tools &raquo; Mozilla Archive
 Format &raquo; Preferences</b> menu item.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>When an archive is opened:</dt>
  <dd>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Open contents in new tabs</b> (default) - Opens all resources in
       new tabs. If your archive is big, this could cause opening the archive to
       take a long time.</li>
      <li><b>Show list of open archives, and ask for action</b> - Displays a
       dialog of all the open archives in a tree form, you select which files
       you would like displayed in tabs. You can also perform other actions from
       the same dialog, like opening MAFF archives using the <tt>jar:</tt>
       protocol.</li>
      <li><b>Only add to the list of open archives, showing nothing</b> - Allows
       you to open as many archives as you want and browse to display any of the
       saved resources after complete.</li>
    </ol>
  </dd>
  <dt>Save extended metadata in MAFF archives</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>With this preference enabled, additional page information such as
     history, text zoom and scroll position is saved for each page. There is
     currently no preference to restore this saved information as yet.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Show a message box when completing a single page archival</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>With this preference enabled, an alert box is displayed each time a
     single page is saved in an archive. This is not applicable if multiple
     tabs are being saved in an archive at once.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<img src="images/prefsDialog-paneFileAssociations.png" alt="">

<dl>
  <dt>File associations</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This preferences pane allows you to create or refresh file associations
     on Windows, for the MAFF and MHTML formats separately.</p>
    <p>File associations are not removed when uninstalling MAF of Firefox
     itself.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<img src="images/prefsDialog-paneAdvanced.png" alt="">

<dl>
  <dt>Temporary folder</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This preference allows you to customize the location of the temporary
     files required to open and save the web archives.</p>
    <p>If unspecified, this location defaults to the <tt>maftemp</tt>
     subdirectory of the system temporary directory.</p>
    <p>If customized, the absolute path to the specified location is remembered.
     The contents of the selected folder will be lost if the <b>Clear temporary
     folder when browser exits</b> option is selected. There is usually no need
     to customize the temporary folder unless you use different Firefox profiles
     on the same computer at the same time.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Clear temporary folder when browser exits</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This option is enabled by default. If disabled, the contents of the
     temporary directory are preserved after the browser exits, and must be
     cleaned up manually.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Rewrite absolute URLs in open archives</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>With this preference enabled, the archived web pages would be processed
     as they finish loading in tabs. The processing would replace absolute links
     to resources in the page with local resources in the archive (if possible).
     This would allow users to browse linked pages in an archive seamlessly.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>When saving complete web page contents:</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This preference controls which method is used to find all the web
     resources (images, subpages, ...) that are included in the web page being
     saved. This step is preliminary to archiving all the resources in MAFF or
     MHTML format.</p>
    <p>You may change this preference if the saved pages seem to be really
     different from their original version, to achieve a better result.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Use browser's standard save system</b> (default) - With this
       setting, the web pages are saved in the same way as when using the
       <b>Save Page As</b>, <b>Web Page, complete</b> option of Firefox. How
       much of the web page is actually saved depends on the version of Firefox
       being used.</li>
      <li><b>Use MAF internal save component (advanced)</b> - This component
       saves images linked in CSS pages but it currently does not work on pages
       with frames.</li>
    </ol>
  </dd>
</dl>
