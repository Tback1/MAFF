<h5>MAF advanced preferences</h5>
<p>The default settings in effect when you install MAF for the first time
 should be enough to allow correct loading and saving of MAF and MHTML files.
 To customize advanced aspects of page loading and archiving, the extension's
 preferences dialog can be accessed from the <b>Tools &raquo; Mozilla Archive
 Format &raquo; Preferences</b> menu item.</p>

<p><i>The following screenshots show the preferences dialog of a previous
 version of MAF on Linux.</i></p>

<dl>
  <dt>Temporary folder</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Location of the temporary directory used by MAF to extract archive files.
     Currently defaults to the <tt>maf/maftemp</tt> subdirectory of the user
     profile's directory.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Clear Temporary folder when browser exits</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This option is enabled by default. If disabled, the contents of the
     temporary directory used by MAF to extract archive files is preserved after
     the browser exits, and must be cleaned up manually.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Open Archive Mode</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>There are three open modes available. These configure how MAF behaves
     once an archive is opened.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Show open dialog box</b> - Displays a dialog of all the open
       archives in a tree form, you select which files you would like
       displayed in tabs.</li>
      <li><b>Open all HTML in new tabs</b> (default) - Opens all resources in
       new tabs. If your archive is big, this could cause opening the archive to
       take a long time.</li>
      <li><b>Do nothing</b> - Allows you to open as many archives as you want
       and browse to display any of the saved resources after complete.</li>
    </ol>
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Save Extended Meta-Data</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>With this preference enabled, additional page information such as
     history, text zoom and scroll position is saved for each page. There is
     currently no preference to restore this saved information as yet.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Use alternative save component</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>With this preference enabled, a different component is used by MAF to
     serialize HTML pages to disk. This component saves images linked in CSS
     pages but it currently does <b>NOT</b> work on framed pages.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Alert on single archive complete</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>With this preference enabled, an alert box is displayed each time a
     single page is saved in an archive. This is not applicable if multiple
     tabs are being saved in an archive at once.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Rewrite Archive Document URLs</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>With this preference enabled, the DOM tree of expanded archive HTML files
     would be processed as they finish loading in tabs. The processing would
     iterate over all the links in the page and replace absolute links to
     resources in the page with local resources in the archive (if possible).
     This would allow users to browse linked pages in an archive seamlessly.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Enable MAF Protocol</dt>
  <dt>Enable document.write override</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>These preferences control features that are not available in the upcoming
     official release of MAF for Firefox 3. For reference, you can see
     <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070313001315/maf.mozdev.org/preferences.html">the
     old documentation still accessible at the Internet Archive</a>.</p>
