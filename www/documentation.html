<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Web archives are a convenient means to preserve web pages. They store all
the text, images, and other resources of a web page in a single file. When a web
archive is moved or renamed, the saved pages are unchanged.</p>
<h3><a name="saving"></a>Saving web archives</h3>
<p>Mozilla Archive Format provides two new options of file type in the <i>Save
As</i> dialog box:</p>
<img src="images/saveAsDialog.png" alt="">
<dl>
  <dt>Web Archive, MAFF zipped</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>This option saves one or more pages inside a single <a
    href="maff-file-format.html">MAFF</a> archive. MAFF archives are compressed
  using the universal, cross-platform ZIP specification for saving multiple
  files in one archive.</p>
  <p>MAFF archives can be opened in the browser. If multiple tabs were
  saved, opening a MAFF archive opens all the tabs, exactly the way they were
  when they were saved.</p>
  <p>It is possible to view the original location from which the page was
  saved. The contents of the archive, including any embedded media files, can be
  inspected and extracted using any ZIP utility.</p>
  <p>The Mozilla Archive Format extension generates MAFF archives using the
  fast, native ZIP implementation embedded in the Mozilla browser. The resulting
  files are usually smaller than the equivalent MHTML archives, and opening this
  kind of file is faster.</p>
  <p>However, Microsoft Internet Explorer cannot open MAFF files natively.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Web Archive, MHTML</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>This web archive format, also known as MHT, is used by Microsoft's
  Internet Explorer browser. This option saves a single page inside a MIME HTML
  file, or MHTML archive.</p>
  <p>MHTML files are encoded, not compressed. The encoding usually increases
  the size of the saved media files compared to the original. At present, the
  contents of an MHTML archive can be decoded by only a limited number of web
  browsers, or by using special utilities. However, MHTML archive format has the
  advantage that it can be shared with those who use only Internet Explorer.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="metadata"></a>Additional information saved in web archives</h4>
<p>When you save a page as a web archive, the following additional
information about the tab or tabs saved is stored in the archive:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>original location</b> from which the page was saved. This
  normally matches what is displayed in the address bar of the browser.</li>
  <li>The <b>date and time</b> the page was saved.</li>
  <li>The <b>title</b> of the page, if present.</li>
  <li>The <b>character set</b> in effect at the time the page was saved.
  <p>If the character set was changed manually using the <b>View &raquo;
  Character Encoding</b> menu item, the custom choice is remembered. This allows the
  document to be displayed correctly when it is reopened from the archive, even
  if it contains international characters.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If you re-save an already archived page to a different file, the date and
time saved, and the location of the original archive, are preserved.</p>
<h3><a name="opening"></a>Opening web archives</h3>
<p>After Mozilla Archive Format is installed, web archives can be opened as
with any saved web page.</p>
<h3><a name="fileassociations"></a>Creating file associations</h3>
<p>On Windows, Mozilla Archive Format can create file associations to open
web archives by double-clicking the file names in Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>File associations can be controlled from the welcome page that is
displayed when the extension is installed for the first time, or when the <b>Refresh
File Associations</b> link is selected from the <b>Actions</b> options pane.</p>
<p>In the welcome page, you can choose whether file associations are
created, for the MAFF and MHTML formats separately.</p>
<p>File associations are always created explicitly for the current user of
the system. In addition, if the current user has administration privileges,
default file associations for all users are also created.</p>
<p>File associations are <i>not</i> removed when uninstalling the add-on or
the browser itself.</p>
<h3><a name="archiveinfo"></a>Viewing information about archived pages: Web
page information panel</h3>
<img src="images/viewArchive.png" alt="">
<p>When you display an archived page, an additional icon appears in the
address bar of the browser (default operation). To display information about
each saved web page, first choose a tab, if more than one page was saved. Then
left-click on the icon to display the following information about that page:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>original location</b> the archived page was saved from, if
  available.</li>
  <li>The <b>date and time</b> of the save operation, if available.</li>
</ul>
<p>The original location is a link. You can left-click it to open the
original page in the same tab, or you can use the appropriate key combinations
to open the link in a new tab or a new window.</p>
<p>From the web page information panel you can choose <i>Browse Open
Archives</i>. The <i>Archives</i> dialog provides additional information about all
the web pages in the archive. The information displayed can be selected with the
mouse and copied to the clipboard.</p>
<p>Display the icon in the lower right-hand corner of the status bar by
choosing that add-on option. You can also control the visibility and position of
the icon from the <a href="#interface">interface options</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="extensions"></a>Integration with other extensions</h2>
<p>One of the key features of Mozilla Archive Format is that it integrates
not only with the browser but with other extensions also.</p>
<p>Some of the other extensions, like UnMHT, must be installed separately.
Other extensions, like Save Complete, are embedded and updated together with
Mozilla Archive Format. Here is a list of extensions that inter-operate with the
Mozilla Archive Format extension:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4838">Multiple
  Tab Handler</a>, by Shimoda Hiroshi</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>This extension adds a multiple selection interface and a new context
  menu to the Firefox tab bar.</p>
  <p>Mozilla Archive Format integrates with the tab selection context menu
  and adds an entry to save the selected tabs in an archive. For MHTML archives,
  multiple files are created, while for MAFF archives all the tabs are saved in
  a single file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4723">Save
  Complete</a>, by Stephen Augenstein</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>The Save Complete extension is integrated with Mozilla Archive Format,
  but must be <a href="#savecomplete">enabled from the options</a>.</p>
  <p>This extension replaces the system used by the browser to save complete
  web pages. The new system correctly handles style sheets referencing image
  files, that otherwise would not be saved, causing some pages to appear
  differently.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/834">File Title</a>,
  by Pavel Cvrcek</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>The functionality of the File Title extension is also available from
  the Mozilla Archive Format <a href="#main">options</a>.</p>
  <p>This extension replaces the default file name suggested in the <i>Save
  As</i> dialog box with the title of the page being saved.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/712">Title Save</a>,
  by gm</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>This extension is similar to File Title, but does not affect the
  default behavior. It adds a new item in the <b>File</b> menu to use the title
  of the page, instead of the file name, in the <i>Save As</i> dialog box.</p>
  <p>You can use the new command to save MAFF and MHTML archives too.</p>
  <p>You may install this extension if you want to selectively use the page
  title instead of the original file name. In this case, ensure that the
  browser's default naming strategy is selected in the <a href="#main">options</a>,
  otherwise the title of the page might be used in all cases.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/8051">UnMHT</a>, by
  Arai</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>This extension adds new options in the <b>File</b> menu to save MHTML
  archives, providing other advanced features also.</p>
  <p>If UnMHT is installed, you can continue to use Mozilla Archive Format
  to create and open MAFF archives, while MHTML archives are opened with UnMHT.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<h2><a name="converting"></a>Converting previously saved pages to other
file formats</h2>
<p>You probably already have some web pages saved among your local files.
These pages are often stored as file&nbsp;/&nbsp;folder pairs (like <tt>Page.html</tt>
and <tt>Page_files</tt>), and you may want to convert them to a web archive
format for easier maintenance as a single file.</p>
<p>You may also want to convert saved pages from one web archive format to
another, for example from MHTML to MAFF to save disk space, or from MAFF to
MHTML to achieve compatibility with Internet Explorer.</p>
<h3><a name="convertingonepage"></a>Converting single pages</h3>
<p>Converting a single page that was previously saved locally is easy. Just
open the page in the browser and re-save it in another file format. The Mozilla
Archive Format extension handles the details of the conversion process, and
preserves the information about the original source, if available.</p>
<p>When converting a web page that is not stored in an archive, the
following information is preserved:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>date and time</b> of the original save operation is obtained
  from the local file's last modification time.</li>
  <li>The <b>original location</b> is obtained from the special comment
  some browsers embed in the page when they save it. If not available, the local
  address is used.
  <p>If the page was saved with Internet Explorer, the original location is
  stored like <code>&lt;!-- saved from url=(0023)http://www.example.org/
  --&gt;</code>.</p>
  <p>If the page was saved using the standalone or the integrated Save
  Complete extension for Firefox, the original location is stored like <code>&lt;!--
  Source is http://www.example.org/ --&gt;</code>.</p>
  <p>If the page was saved using SeaMonkey or Firefox without the Save
  Complete extension, the original location is not available.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>When converting a web archive to another archive format, all the
information that is supported by the destination file format is preserved.</p>
<p>When saving an archived page as a complete page outside of an archive, if
the integrated Save Complete extension is enabled, the original source location
is stored in a comment inside the saved page.</p>
<h3><a name="convertingmorepages"></a>Converting multiple pages</h3>
<p>If you have many saved pages that you want to convert to another file
format, you can use the <i>Saved Pages Conversion Wizard</i>. You can start the
wizard using the <b>Tools &raquo; Mozilla Archive Format &raquo; Convert
Saved Pages</b> menu item. If the <b>Mozilla Archive Format</b> sub-menu is hidden,
you must first enable it from the <a href="#interface">interface options</a>.</p>
<p><b>Important considerations:</b> The wizard allows you to convert all the
pages located in one folder, optionally including all its sub-folders. The
wizard automates the manual tasks of opening each page and saving them using
another file format. When using the conversion wizard, the following information
must be considered:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The wizard operates on multiple files, but the results for each file
  are equivalent to <a href="#convertingonepage">converting a single page</a> by
  opening and saving it manually. The information about the original location is
  preserved, and the faithfulness of the resulting converted pages depends on
  the destination file formats and the current <a href="#main">options</a>.</li>
  <li>For best results, it is recommended that you <a href="#savecomplete">enable
  the Save Complete component</a> before starting the conversion.</li>
  <li>If you want to convert from MHTML to another file format, like MAFF,
  and you have installed the <a
    href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/8051">UnMHT</a> extension,
  you must disable it for the duration of the conversion process.</li>
  <li>The wizard only operates on one page for each file. If you want to
  convert from a multi-page MAFF archive to another file format, you should
  extract the archive first, using an ordinary ZIP utility. If you want, you can
  then convert the resulting complete web pages to MHTML using the conversion
  wizard.</li>
  <li>If you are converting from a web archive format, ensure you have
  enough free space in your temporary folder, since the archives are normally
  extracted to the temporary folder before conversion.
  <p>If you need to convert many pages and don't have enough free space, you
  may want to convert only some of them at a time, and restart the browser
  between each conversion batch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>In some cases, the automatic conversion of complex web pages may
  fail. These pages may need manual conversion.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="selectfiles"></a>Selecting which files to convert</h4>
<img src="images/convertDialog-pageFormats.png" alt="" vspace="2"> <img
  src="images/convertDialog-pageFoldersSource.png" alt="" vspace="2">
<p><b>First select the source and destination file formats.</b> Then select
the folder in which the source files are located. You can decide to look in
sub-folders of the selected folder, or you can convert only the files that are
placed directly inside the selected folder.</p>
<p>The selected source format determines how the wizard will look for source
files. The MAFF and MHTML web archive formats are recognized by their extension,
respectively <code class="maf-file-ext">.maff</code> and either <code
  class="maf-file-ext">.mht</code> or <code class="maf-file-ext">.mhtml</code>.
Complete web pages are recognized because they have an associated support
folder, for example <tt>Page.html</tt> and <tt>Page_files</tt>, but also <tt>Page</tt>
(without extension) and <tt>Page_files</tt>. Web pages saved as single files,
without support folders, are recognized by their extension only.</p>
<p>If you are using your browser in a language other than English, the
recognition of additional support folder suffixes will be enabled. For example,
if you are using your browser in French, a support folder named <tt>Page_fichiers</tt>
is recognized, in addition to the English <tt>Page_files</tt>.</p>
<p>If you previously saved pages using a browser in a different language
than the current one, the support folder names may not be recognized correctly,
and you might have to adjust the list of recognized suffixes in the <a
  href="#internalsettings">internal configuration settings</a>.</p>
<p>The selected destination format determines how the wizard will assign the
output file names. The extension in the source file name, if present, is always
replaced with the correct extension for the destination file format. For MHTML,
the <a href="#internalsettings">internal configuration settings</a> determine
whether the <code class="maf-file-ext">.mht</code> or <code class="maf-file-ext">.mhtml</code>
extension is used.</p>
<img src="images/convertDialog-pageFoldersDest.png" alt="">
<p><b>Then select the destination folder.</b> You may want to place the
converted files in a different folder from the original files; that option is
particularly useful if you are converting from a read-only source, such as a
CD-ROM or a DVD. The original folder structure is always preserved, so that if a
source file is located in a sub-folder of the original folder, the converted
file will be located in a sub-folder in the destination folder with the same
name as the sub-folder in the original folder.</p>
<p>You may also choose to place the converted files in the same folder as
the original files. Each converted file will be placed in the same folder as its
original, with the same file name but with a different extension. In that case,
after conversion you may want to move the originals manually, by selecting a
folder that will be used as a bin for the original files that have been
successfully converted.</p>
<p>If you are converting from the MAFF file format and use of the "jar:"
protocol is enabled in the <a href="#internalsettings">internal
configuration settings</a>, you will not be able to move the source files to another
folder, since the browser will lock the files in place until it is closed. If
you want to move the source files when converting from MAFF to another format,
you should disable the use of the "jar:" protocol for the duration of the
conversion process.</p>
<p>The conversion wizard will never delete or overwrite the source files.
Since in unusual cases the converted pages may not be entirely faithful to the
original, you should always keep a backup of your source files, even after a
successful conversion.</p>
<img src="images/convertDialog-pageCandidates-select.png" alt="">
<p><b>Finally, the source folder is scanned to locate the original
files.</b> Depending on how many files are present in the source, this operation may
require some time. If you are working with large folder trees, you may want to
repeat the wizard multiple times, converting one sub-folder at a time.</p>
<p>Before the actual conversion begins, you have the option of fine-tuning
your selection. You can also verify that the source files have been identified
correctly. In addition to the source file name, support folder name, and
sub-folder in the list of files, you may display other columns like the full
source, destination, and bin paths.</p>
<p>If for any reason the destination file or support folder is already
present, or if a file or support folder is already present in the folder where
the source file would be moved after conversion, the source file name will
appear in the list, but the selection checkbox will be disabled. This often
indicates that the source file was converted successfully during a previous run
of the wizard.</p>
<h4><a name="convertfiles"></a>Completing the conversion</h4>
<img src="images/convertDialog-pageCandidates-results.png" alt="">
<p>After you have selected the files to be converted, click the <b>Finish</b>
button to start the conversion process. Depending on the number of files, this
process may require some time.</p>
<p>You can cancel the conversion at any time by closing the wizard or by
using the <b>Back</b> button. Canceling the operation may require some time.</p>
<p>When the operation is finished, you can see the count of how many files
have been successfully converted and how many conversions failed. The icon near
each file name indicates its current status: <img src="images/cbox-dis.gif"
  alt=""> not selected, <img src="images/cbox-dis-check.gif" alt="">
already converted, <img src="images/cbox-status-enqueued.gif" alt="">
waiting for conversion, <img src="images/cbox-status-working.gif" alt="">
currently converting, <img src="images/cbox-status-failure.gif" alt="">
conversion failed, or <img src="images/cbox-status-success.gif" alt="">
conversion succeeded.</p>
<p>Detailed information about the reasons for conversion failures is
available in the <i>Error Console</i>, accessible from the <b>Tools &raquo;
Error Console</b> menu item.</p>
<p>If you are satisfied with the results, click the <b>Finish</b> button to
close the window. You may also use the <b>Back</b> button to retry the
conversion process with the same or different settings.</p>
<h2><a name="preferences"></a>Options</h2>
<h3><a name="main"></a><a name="savecomplete"></a><a name="exactpersist"></a>Main</h3>
<img src="images/prefsDialog-paneMain.png" alt="">
<dl>
  <dt>When saving complete web page contents:</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>This option controls which method is used to find all the web resources
  (images, styles, sub-frames, ...) that are included in the web page being
  saved.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Use browser's standard save system.</b> With this setting, the
    web pages are saved by the browser. How much of the web page is actually
    saved depends on the version of the browser being used.</li>
    <li><b>Preserve scripts and source using &#8220;Save
    Complete&#8221;.</b> This option saves more content, thanks to the integrated
    Save Complete extension written by Stephen Augenstein.
    <p>This save mode attempts to preserve the dynamic features of the page
    by keeping all the scripts and the original page source code. However,
    content generated by scripts may be missing from the resulting page. Note
    that Mozilla Archive Format always uses the integrated version of Save
    Complete, even if you also have the standalone version of Save Complete
    add-on installed.</p>
    <p>Improvements to Save Complete are periodically included in new
    versions of Mozilla Archive Format.</p>
    </li>
    <li><b>Take a faithful snapshot of the page.</b> (default) This is the
    most accurate save mode. It captures the current state of the page and
    creates an exact replica, including the current values of form fields and
    video and audio embedded in the page. This save mode works especially well
    for pages that make extensive use of scripts or use dynamic technologies
    like AJAX.
    <p>The resulting page will be static, as scripts are disabled by the
    save operation to preserve the integrity of the result when it is displayed
    again.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Note that the selected method of saving is used not only when saving
  archives, but also when saving complete pages using the <b>Web Page,
  complete</b> file type.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Create MHTML files fully compatible with other browsers:</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>When this option is enabled, Mozilla Archive Format creates MHTML files
  according to the original specification, allowing any browser to open the
  archives correctly, even in case of very complex pages.</p>
  <p>If this option is disabled, Mozilla Archive Format will generate a
  specific MHTML variant that will open much more quickly in Firefox or
  SeaMonkey, even for very large documents. However, other browsers will not be
  able to display a web page with proper formatting if the saved page contains
  nested CSS style sheets or inner frames.</p>
  <p>Mozilla Archive Format is only able to create compatible MHTML files
  using the integrated Save Complete component or the Faithful Save system.
  Otherwise, only the specific MHTML variant is available.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>For the suggested file name:</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>This preference controls which method is used to select the default
  file name in the <i>Save As</i> dialog box.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Use browser's standard naming strategy.</b> With this setting,
    the Mozilla Archive Format extension does not alter the current behavior,
    which is determined by the browser or by <a href="#extensions">other
    installed extensions</a>. If no other extension affecting this behavior is
    installed, the original name of the file is suggested instead of the title
    of the page.</li>
    <li><b>Use the title of the page whenever possible.</b> (default) With
    this setting, the title of the page is preferred to the original file name.
    This is done for all HTML and XHTML pages, unless the server from which you
    are downloading the page explicitly asked the browser to use a specific file
    name. Note that if <a href="#extensions">other extensions</a> affecting this
    behavior are installed, this setting may not work as expected.</li>

  archive.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b><tt>dynamic</tt></b> (default)&nbsp; Use maximum compression for
    all files, but do not re-compress media files.</li>

  <p>With this preference enabled, history, text zoom, and scroll position
  is saved for each page. At present this additional information is ignored when
  the archive is opened.</p>

  <dd>
  <p>If this option is selected, and you do not type a file extension in the
  <i>Save As</i> dialog box, or file extensions are hidden, the complete <code
    class="maf-file-ext">.mhtml</code> extension will be appended to the file
  name of MHTML archives, instead of the more common <code class="maf-file-ext">.mht</code>
  extension.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>extensions.maf.temp.clearonexit</tt></dt>
  <dd>
  <p>This option is enabled by default. If disabled, the contents of the
  temporary directory are preserved after the browser exits, and must be emptied
  manually.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>extensions.maf.temp.folder</tt></dt>
  <dd>
  <p>Use this preference to choose the location of the temporary files
  required to open and save the web archives. <b>The contents of this folder
  will be lost if <tt>extensions.maf.temp.clearonexit</tt> is <tt>true</tt></b>.</p>
  <p>If not specified, this location defaults to a sub-folder of the system
  temporary folder, which is different for every browser profile.</p>
  <p>If customized, the absolute path to the specified location is
  remembered, regardless of the system temporary folder path.</p>
