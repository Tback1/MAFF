<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Mozilla Archive Format, or MAF, is a Firefox extension that enables your
 browser to save, load and manage <i>web archives</i>. For a quick overview,
 have a look at the <a href="screenshots.html">screenshots page</a>.</p>
<p>Web archives are a convenient means to save and preserve web pages locally,
 since they allow you to store entire pages, including the images, in a single
 file. You can move around or rename a web archive without the risk of breaking
 the integrity of the saved pages it contains.</p>
<h3><a name="saving"></a>Saving web archives</h3>
<p>As soon as MAF is installed, you get two new options for the file type in
 the <i>Save As</i> dialog box:</p>
<img src="images/saveAsDialog.png" alt="">
<dl>
  <dt>Web Archive, MAFF zipped</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This option allows you to save one or more pages inside a single
     <a href="maff-file-format.html">Mozilla Archive Format File</a>, or MAFF
     archive. This type of archive is compressed using the universal,
     cross-platform ZIP specification.</p>
    <p>You can open MAFF archives again in the browser (and you get some
     commodities like the ability to view the original location the page was
     saved from), or you can inspect and extract the archive's contents,
     including all the embedded media files, without the browser using any
     ordinary ZIP utility.</p>
    <p>The Mozilla Archive Format extension generates MAFF archives using the
     fast, native ZIP implementation embedded in the Mozilla browser. The
     resulting files are usually smaller than the equivalent MHTML archives,
     and opening this kind of files is faster.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Web Archive, MHTML</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This option allows you to save a single page inside a MIME HTML file, or
     MHTML archive. This format is also known as MHT, and is the web archive
     format used by Internet Explorer.</p>
    <p>MHTML files are encoded, not compressed. The encoding usually increases
     the size of the saved media files, compared to the original. At present,
     the contents of an MHTML archive can be decoded only by a limited
     number of web browsers, or using specific utilities. However, this archive
     format can be exchanged more easily with Internet Explorer.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<h4><a name="metadata"></a>Additional information saved in web archives</h4>
<p>When you save a page as a web archive, the following additional information
 about the save operation is stored in the archive:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>original location</b> the page was saved from. This normally
   matches what is displayed in the address bar of the browser.</li>
  <li>The <b>date and time</b> of the save operation.</li>
  <li>The <b>title</b> of the page, if present.</li>
  <li>The <b>character set</b> in effect at the time the page was saved. If the
   character set was changed manually using the <b>View &raquo; Character
   Encoding</b> menu item of Firefox, the custom choice is remembered. This
   allows the document to be displayed correctly when it is reopened from the
   archive, even if it contains internationalized characters.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you resave an already archived page to a different file, the save time and
 location from the original archive are preserved.</p>
<h3><a name="opening"></a>Opening web archives</h3>
<p>By default, once MAF is installed, web archives can be opened using the
 ordinary <b>File &raquo; Open File</b> menu item of Firefox or using
 drag-and-drop, as you would open any other saved web page.</p>
<p>Under Windows, MAF can also create for you the
 <a href="#fileassociations">file associations</a> that allow opening the web
 archives by double-clicking them from Windows Explorer.</p>
<h4><a name="archiveinfo"></a>Viewing information about archived pages</h4>
<img src="images/viewArchive.png" alt="">
<p>By default, when you are displaying an archived page, an additional icon
 appears in the address bar of the browser. You can click the icon to display
 the following information about the archived page:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>original location</b> the page was saved from, if available.</li>
  <li>The <b>date and time</b> of the save operation, if available.</li>
</ul>
<p>The original location is a link. You can click it with the left mouse button
 to open the original page in the same tab, or you can use the appropriate key
 combinations to open the link in a new tab or a new window.</p>
<p>From the popup panel with the information on the page, you can also access
 the <i>Archives</i> dialog, that provides additional information on all the
 archives that have been opened during the current browsing session.</p>
<p>The icon can also be displayed in the status bar. You can control the
 visibility and position of the icon from the <a href="#interface">interface
 preferences</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="extensions"></a>Integration with other extensions</h2>
<p>One of the key features of Mozilla Archive Format is that it integrates not
 only with Firefox, but with other extensions as well, to provide a smooth user
 experience.</p>
<p>Some of these extensions, like UnMHT, must be installed separately; other
 extensions, like Save Complete, are embedded and updated together with MAF.</p>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4838">Multiple Tab
   Handler</a>, by Shimoda Hiroshi</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This extension adds a multiple selection interface and a new context menu
     to the Firefox tab bar.</p>
    <p>MAF integrates with the tab selection context menu and adds an entry to
     save the selected tabs in an archive. For MHTML archives, MAF creates
     multiple files, while for MAFF archives all the tabs are saved in a
     single file.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4723">Save Complete</a>,
   by Stephen Augenstein</dt>
  <dd>
    <p><i>The Save Complete extension is integrated with MAF, but must be
     <a href="#savecomplete">enabled from the preferences</a>.</i></p>
    <p>This extension replaces the system used by the browser to save complete
     web pages. The new system correctly handles style sheets referencing image
     files, that otherwise would not be saved causing some pages to appear
     differently.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/834">File Title</a>, by
   Pavel Cvrcek</dt>
  <dd>
    <p><i>The functionality of the File Title extension is also available from
     the MAF <a href="#main">preferences</a>.</i></p>
    <p>This extension replaces the default file name suggested in the <i>Save
     As</i> dialog box with the title of the page being saved.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/712">Title Save</a>, by
   <i>gm</i></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This extension is similar to File Title, but does not affect the default
     behavior and adds a new item in the <b>File</b> menu to use the title of
     the page instead of the file name in the <i>Save As</i> dialog box.</p>
    <p>You can use the new command to save MAFF and MHTML archives too.</p>
    <p>You may install this extension if you want to selectively use the page
     title instead of the original file name. In this case, ensure that the
     default browser's naming strategy is selected in the MAF
     <a href="#main">preferences</a>, otherwise the title of the page might be
     used in all cases.</i></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/8051">UnMHT</a>, by
   Arai</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This extension adds new options in the <b>File</b> menu to save MHTML
     archives, providing also other advanced features.</p>
    <p>If UnMHT is installed, you can continue to use MAF to create and open
     MAFF archives, while MHTML archives are opened with UnMHT.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name="converting"></a>Converting previously saved pages to other file
 formats</h2>
<p>You probably already have some web pages saved among your local files. These
 pages are often stored as file&nbsp;/&nbsp;folder pairs (like
 <tt>Page.html</tt> and <tt>Page_files</tt>), and you may want to convert them
 to a web archive format for easier maintenance.</p>
<p>You may also want to convert saved pages from a web archive format to
 another, for example from MHTML to MAFF to save disk space or vice versa to
 achieve compatibility with Internet Explorer.</p>
<h3><a name="convertingonepage"></a>Converting single pages</h3>
<p>Converting a single page that was previously saved locally is as easy as
 opening the page in the browser and resaving it in another file format. The
 Mozilla Archive Format extension handles the details of the conversion process,
 and preserves the information about the original source, if available.</p>
<p>When converting a web page that is not stored in an archive, the following
 information is preserved:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>date and time</b> of the original save operation is obtained from
   the local file's last modification time.</li>
  <li>
    <p>The <b>original location</b> is obtained from the special comment some
     browsers embed in the page when they save it. If not available, the local
     address is used.</p>
    <p>If the page was saved with Internet Explorer, the original location is
     stored like <code>&lt;!-- saved from url=(0023)http://www.example.org/
     --&gt;</code>.</p>
    <p>If the page was saved using the standalone or the integrated Save
     Complete extension for Firefox, the original location is stored like
     <code>&lt;!-- Source is http://www.example.org/ --&gt;</code>.</p>
    <p>If the page was saved using Firefox without the Save Complete extension,
     the original location is not available.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>When converting a web archive to another archive format, all the information
 that is supported by the destination file format is preserved.</p>
<p>When saving an archived page as a complete page outside of an archive, if the
 integrated Save Complete extension is enabled, the original source location is
 stored in a comment inside the saved page.</p>
<h3><a name="convertingmorepages"></a>Converting multiple pages</h3>
<p>If you have many saved pages that you want to convert to another file format,
 you can use the <i>Saved Pages Conversion Wizard</i>. You can start the wizard
 using the <b>Tools &raquo; Mozilla Archive Format &raquo; Convert Saved
 Pages</b> menu item. If the <b>Mozilla Archive Format</b> submenu is hidden,
 you must first enable it from the <a href="#interface">interface
 preferences</a>.</p>
<p>The wizard allows you to convert all the pages located in one folder,
 optionally including all its subfolders, automating the task of opening each
 page and saving it using another file format. When using the conversion wizard,
 the following information must be considered:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The wizard operates on multiple files, but the results for each file are
   equivalent to <a href="#convertingonepage">converting a single page</a> by
   opening and saving it manually. The same information about the original
   location is preserved, and the <b>fidelity</b> of the resulting page depends
   on the destination file formats and the current
   <a href="#main">preferences</a>.</li>
  <li>For best results, it is recommended that you
   <a href="#savecomplete">enable the Save Complete component</a> before
    starting the conversion.</li>
  <li>If you want to convert from MHTML to another file format, like MAFF, and
   you have installed the
   <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/8051">UnMHT</a> extension,
   you must disable it for the duration of the conversion process.</li>
  <li>The wizard only operates on one page for each file. If you want to convert
   from a multi-page MAFF archive to another file format, you should extract the
   archive first, using an ordinary ZIP utility. If you want, you can then
   convert the resulting complete web pages to MHTML using the conversion
   wizard.</li>
  <li>If you are converting from a web archive format, ensure you have enough
   free space in your temporary folder, since the archives are normally
   extracted to the temporary folder before conversion. If you need to convert
   many pages and don't have enough free space, you may want to convert only
   some of them at a time, and restart the browser between each conversion
   batch. You can also move the temporary folder to a different drive in the
   <a href="#advanced">advanced preferences</a>.</li>
  <li>In some cases, the automatic conversion of complex web pages may fail.
   These pages may need manual conversion.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="selectfiles"></a>Selecting which files to convert</h4>
<img src="images/convertDialog-pageFormats.png" alt="" vspace="2">
<img src="images/convertDialog-pageFoldersSource.png" alt="" vspace="2">
<p>First, you must select the source and destination file formats, and the
 source folder to be sought for source files. You can decide to look in
 subfolders of the selected folder or to convert only the files that are placed
 directly inside the selected folder.</p>
<p>The selected source format determines how the wizard will look for source
 files. The MAFF and MHTML web archive formats are recognized by their
 extension, respectively <code class="maf-file-ext">.maff</code> and either
 <code class="maf-file-ext">.mht</code> or
 <code class="maf-file-ext">.mhtml</code>. Complete web pages are recognized
 because they have an associated support folder, for example <tt>Page.html</tt>
 and <tt>Page_files</tt>, but also <tt>Page</tt> (without extension) and
 <tt>Page_files</tt>. Web pages saved as single files, without support folders,
 are recognized by their extension only.</p>
<p>If you are using Firefox in a language other than English, the recognition of
 additional support folder suffixes will be enabled. For example, if you are
 using Firefox in French, a support folder named <tt>Page_fichiers</tt> can be
 recognized, in addition to <tt>Page_files</tt>. If you previously saved pages
 using a browser in a different language than the one in which you are using
 Firefox, the support folder names may not be recognized correctly.</p>
<p>The selected destination format determines how the wizard will assign the
 output file names. The extension in the source file name, if present, is
 always replaced with the correct extension for the destination file format. For
 MHTML, the <a href="#advanced">advanced preferences</a> determine whether the
 <code class="maf-file-ext">.mht</code> or
 <code class="maf-file-ext">.mhtml</code> extension is used.</p>
<img src="images/convertDialog-pageFoldersDest.png" alt="">
<p>The next step consists in selecting the destination folder. If you want, you
 can place the converted files in a different folder from the original files.
 This is particularly useful if you are converting from a read-only source, like
 a CD-ROM or a DVD. The original folder structure is always preserved, so that
 if a source file is located in a subfolder of the original folder, the
 converted file will be located in a subfolder with the same name in the
 destination folder.</p>
<p>You may also choose to place the converted files near the original files.
 Each converted file will be placed in the same folder as its original, with the
 same file name, but with a different extension. In this case, you may want to
 move the original out of the way, by selecting a folder that will be used as a
 bin for the original files that have been successfully converted.</p>
<p>If you are converting from the MAFF file format and the use of the "jar:"
 protocol is enabled in the <a href="#advanced">advanced preferences</a>, you
 will not be able to move the source files to another folder, since Firefox will
 lock the files in place until it is closed. If you want to use this feature
 when converting from MAFF to another format, you should disable the use of
 the "jar:" protocol for the duration of the conversion process.</p>
<p>The conversion wizard will never delete or overwrite the source files. Since
 the converted pages may not be entirely faithful to the original, you should
 always keep a backup of your source files available, even after a successful
 conversion.</p>
<img src="images/convertDialog-pageCandidates-select.png" alt="">
<p>Finally, the source folder is scanned to locate the original files. Depending
 on how many files are present in the source, this operation may require some
 time. If you are working with large folder trees, you may want to repeat the
 wizard multiple times, converting one subfolder at a time.</p>
<p>Before the actual conversion begins, you have the option of fine-tuning your
 selection, and you can verify that the source files have been identified
 correctly. In the list of files, in addition to the source file name, support
 folder name and subfolder, you may display other columns like the full source,
 destination and bin paths.</p>
<p>If for any reason the destination file or support folder is already present,
 or if a file or support folder is already present in the folder where the
 source file would be moved after conversion, the source file name will appear
 in the list, but the selection checkbox will be disabled. This often indicates
 that the source file was converted successfully during a previous run of the
 wizard.</p>
<h4><a name="convertfiles"></a>Completing the conversion</h4>
<img src="images/convertDialog-pageCandidates-results.png" alt="">
<p>After you have selected the files to be converted, click the <b>Finish</b>
 button to start the conversion process. Depending on the number of files, this
 process may require some time.</p>
<p>You can cancel the conversion at any time by closing the wizard or by using
 the <b>Back</b> button. Canceling the operation may require some time.</p>
<p>When the operation is finished, you can see the count of how many files have
 been successfully converted and how many files failed. The icon near each file
 name indicates its current status: <img src="images/cbox-dis.gif" alt=""> not
 selected, <img src="images/cbox-dis-check.gif" alt=""> already converted,
 <img src="images/cbox-status-enqueued.gif" alt=""> waiting for conversion,
 <img src="images/cbox-status-working.gif" alt=""> currently converting,
 <img src="images/cbox-status-failure.gif" alt=""> conversion failed, or
 <img src="images/cbox-status-success.gif" alt=""> conversion
 succeeded.</p>
<p>Detailed information about the reasons for conversion failures is available
 in the <i>Error Console</i>, accessible from the <b>Tools &raquo; Error
 Console</b> menu item.</p>
<p>If you are satisfied with the results, click the <b>Finish</b> button to
 close the window. You may also use the <b>Back</b> button to retry the
 conversion process with the same settings, or to change your selection and
 repeat the process with different folders.</p>

<h2><a name="preferences"></a>Preferences</h2>
<p>The default settings in effect after installation are enough to allow correct
 loading and saving of both MAFF and MHTML archives. To enable or disable the
 integrated Save Complete extension, customize the interface, or modify advanced
 aspects of page loading and archiving, you can change the extension's
 preferences.</p>
<p>The preferences dialog can be accessed from the <b>Tools &raquo; Mozilla
 Archive Format &raquo; Preferences</b> menu item or from the button in the
 archive information popup. If the <b>Mozilla Archive Format</b> submenu or the
 icon to display the popup are hidden, you can still open the preferences dialog
 using the <b>Options</b> button in the <i>Add-ons</i> dialog, available from
 the <b>Tools &raquo; Add-ons</b> menu item.</p>

<h3><a name="main"></a><a name="savecomplete"></a><a name="exactpersist"></a>Main
 preferences</h3>

<img src="images/prefsDialog-paneMain.png" alt="">

<dl>
  <dt>When saving complete web page contents:</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This preference controls which method is used to find all the web
     resources (images, subpages, ...) that are included in the web page being
     saved. This step is preliminary to archiving all the resources in MAFF or
     MHTML format.</p>
    <p>You may change this preference if the saved pages seem to be really
     different from their original version, to achieve a better result.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Use browser's standard save system</b> (default) - With this
       setting, the web pages are saved by the browser. How much of the web page
       is actually saved depends on the version of Firefox being used.</li>
      <li><b>Preserve scripts and source using "Save Complete"</b> - Allows more
       content to be saved, thanks to the integrated Save Complete extension
       written by Stephen Augenstein. This save mode attempts to preserve the
       dynamic features of the page by keeping all the scripts and the original
       page source code, but content generated by scripts may be missing from
       the resulting page. Note that if you also have a standalone version of
       Save Complete installed, MAF will continue to use the integrated one.
       Improvements to Save Complete are periodically included in new versions
       of MAF.</li>
      <li><b>Take a faithful snapshot of the page</b> - This is the most
       accurate save mode, as it captures the current state of the page and
       creates an exact replica, including the current values of form fields, as
       well as video and audio embedded in the page. This save mode works
       especially well for pages that make extensive use of scripts and use
       dynamic technologies like AJAX. The resulting page will be static, as
       scripts are disabled by the save operation to preserve the integrity of
       the result when it is displayed again.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note that the selected component will be used not only when saving
     archives, but also when saving complete pages using the <b>Save Page
     As</b>, <b>Web Page, complete</b> command of Firefox.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Create MHTML files fully compatible with other browsers</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When this preference is enabled, Mozilla Archive Format will create MHTML
     files according to the original specification, allowing any browser to open
     the archives correctly, even in case of very complex pages. If this
     preference is disabled, MAF will generate a specific MHTML variant, that
     will open much more quickly in Firefox, even for very large documents, but
     that other browsers would not be able to display with proper formatting if
     the saved page contains nested CSS stylesheets or inner frames.</p>
    <p>MAF is only able to create compatible MHTML files using the integrated
     Save Complete component. If the Save Complete component is disabled, only
     the MAF-specific MHTML variant is available.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>For the suggested file name:</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This preference controls which method is used to select the default file
     name in the <i>Save As</i> dialog box.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Use browser's standard naming strategy</b> (default) - With this
       setting, the Mozilla Archive Format extension does not alter the current
       behavior, which is determined by the browser or by
       <a href="#extensions">other installed extensions</a>. If no other
       extension affecting this behavior is installed, the original name of the
       file will be preferred to the title of the page.</li>
      <li><b>Use the title of the page whenever possible</b> - With this
       setting, the title of the page will be preferred to the original file
       name. This is done for all HTML and XHTML pages, unless the server you
       are downloading the page from explicitly asked the browser to use a
       specific file name. Note that if <a href="#extensions">other
       extensions</a> affecting this behavior are installed, this setting may
       not work as expected.</li>
    </ol>
  </dd>
  <dt>Save extended metadata in MAFF archives</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>With this preference enabled, additional page information such as
     history, text zoom and scroll position is saved for each page. There is
     currently no preference to restore this saved information as yet.</p>

       This option is recommended if you are using a theme that is not

     for saving in archives, and are useful if you routinely use the standard
     <i>Save As</i> dialog to save only the text of a page, and need a separate
     option to save a page in an archive without changing the selection in the
     file type drop down list.
    <p>The <b>Save Page In Archive</b> and <b>Save Frame In Archive</b> menu

  <dt>File associations</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This preferences pane allows you to create or refresh file associations
     on Windows, for the MAFF and MHTML formats separately.</p>
    <p>File associations are always created explicitly for the current user of
     the system. In addition, if the current user has administration privileges,
     default file associations for all users are also created.</p>
    <p>File associations are not removed when uninstalling MAF of Firefox
     itself.</p>

<h3><a name="advanced"></a>Advanced preferences</h3>

<img src="images/prefsDialog-paneAdvanced.png" alt="">

<dl>
  <dt>Temporary folder</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This preference allows you to customize the location of the temporary
     files required to open and save the web archives.</p>
    <p>If unspecified, this location defaults to the <tt>maftemp</tt>
     subdirectory of the system temporary directory.</p>
    <p>If customized, the absolute path to the specified location is remembered.
     The contents of the selected folder will be lost if the <b>Clear temporary
     folder when browser exits</b> option is selected. There is usually no need
     to customize the temporary folder unless you use different Firefox profiles
     on the same computer at the same time.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Clear temporary folder when browser exits</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This option is enabled by default. If disabled, the contents of the
     temporary directory are preserved after the browser exits, and must be
     cleaned up manually.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Rewrite absolute URLs in open archives</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>With this preference enabled, the archived web pages would be processed
     as they finish loading in tabs. The processing would replace absolute links
     to resources in the page with local resources in the archive (if possible).
     This would allow users to browse linked pages in an archive seamlessly.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Use the "jar:" protocol to access the contents of MAFF archives</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If this preference is enabled, when you open a MAFF archive its contents
     will be accessed directly using the "jar:" protocol, without being
     extracted.</p>
    <p>However, if you enable this option, the archive files you open will be
     locked, and you will be unable to move, rename or delete them until Firefox
     is closed.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Save using the .mhtml file extension instead of .mht by default</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If this option selected, and you do not type a file extension in the
     <i>Save As</i> dialog box or file extensions are hidden, the complete
     <code class="maf-file-ext">.mhtml</code> extension will be appended to the
     file name of MHTML archives, instead of the more common
     <code class="maf-file-ext">.mht</code> extension.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Display welcome window at next startup</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The welcome dialog is usually displayed only when MAF is installed for
     the first time. All the options that are set by the welcome dialog are also
     available from the preferences, thus it is usually not necessary to display
     the dialog again. This option is only provided as a convenience for
     translators in need of proofreading the text in the welcome dialog
     multiple times.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name="internalsettings"></a>Internal configuration settings</h2>

<p>These configuration settings are not available from the preferences dialog,
but only from the <tt>about:config</tt> page. Usually, they should not be
changed unless there is a specific reason, and non-default settings may
adversely impact functionality or performance.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>extensions.maf.open.maff.ignorecharacterset</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When this setting is enabled, the character set specified for pages saved
     inside MAFF archives is ignored, instead of being enforced when the page is
     displayed. Enabling this option may be useful to troubleshoot
     internationalization issues, but will cause saved pages to be displayed
     incorrectly in most cases.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><tt>extensions.maf.save.maff.compression</tt></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Controls the compression level to use when saving files in a MAFF
     archive.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b><tt>dynamic</tt></b> (default) - Use maximum compression for all
       files, but do not re-compress media files.</li>
      <li><b><tt>best</tt></b> - Use maximum compression for all files.</li>
      <li><b><tt>none</tt></b> - Store all the files uncompressed.</li>
    </ol>
  </dd>
