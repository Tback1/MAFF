  <tr>
    <td align="right">Question:</td>
    <td>Why do I have to install an XPI and then other stuff?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Answer:</td>
    <td>This is still beta software, eventually there should only be an XPI and it'll take care of creating the scripts for you using the default Zip format. (Note from 0.2.18, script copying is included in the XPI).</td>

    <td>I enabled the windows specific options to run files hidden, but it doesn't work. Why?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Answer:</td>
    <td>First make sure that you have windows scripting installed and working. Make sure the path for the location of WSCRIPT.exe is set properly in the preferences. Also make sure invis.vbs exists and the path to that is set properly. If you move the location of your archive and expand scripts, ensure the directory structure you place them in has no spaces in the directory names.</td>

    <td align="right">Question:</td>
    <td>MAF doesn't save the page content properly. What's going on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Answer:</td>
    <td>MAF uses some (very) mangled code version of the File -> Save as -> Web page Complete code, so if it works properly when not using MAF then I've mangled it too much. If that's the case, eMail the URL you're trying to save to me with a brief description of your browser version, platform and what's not right.</td>

    <td>MAF doesn't save international characters in a page properly. What's going on? (Related to the above question).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Answer:</td>
    <td>I've done some not-so-intensive testing of this and it seems to be an issue with the Mozilla DOM serialization and not MAF specifically. Wait for the component to be fixed in Mozilla and it should be fixed in MAF automatically.</td>

<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5" valign="top">
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Question:</td>
    <td>MAF on Mozilla for Windows 2000 and XP just hangs when trying to open or save pages, why?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Answer:</td>
    <td>Not too sure, but it seems that there are some strange permission problems that are created when the scripts are installed. If you can, try moving the MAF script installation to a non-ntfs partition (and modify the scripts accordingly). Alternately, opening the batch files in notepad and saving them back does the trick for some users.</td>

<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5" valign="top">
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Question:</td>
    <td>When I'm saving pages they sometimes take really long, even though I know they're cached. What's going on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Answer:</td>
    <td>Sometimes, websites tell browsers not to cache particular parts of a web page (such as a frame holding an ad). When MAF (or Mozilla to be more precise) tries to save the complete web page, because some parts have been marked "don't cache" it attempts to dowload them again. If you don't mind not saving parts that have not been cached, work offline before you try to save pages. The side effect of this is sometimes you end up having downloads in a queue even though the rest of the page is in the archive. You can ensure that your saved pages are in the archive and cancel the queued downloads.</td>

    <td>There could be various reasons, but odds are your <a href="/preferences.html">preferences</a> are set to do nothing on an archive opening. If you can browse the open archives and it's there, then the preference setting is the issue.</td>

    <td align="right">Question:</td>
    <td>Why can't I save as MHT?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Answer:</td>
    <td>Sheer boredom and still being unemployed was enough of an inspiration for me to do this for MAF 0.2.20. Guess what? That's right, now you <i>can</i> save as MHT. It's not 100% standards compliant, but the saved pages should open properly in IE (which is what you really want it for, right?).</td>

<table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5" valign="top">
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Question:</td>
    <td>When I try to save as MHT or open an MHT I get a prompt saying "A script on this page is causing mozilla to run slowly. If it continues to run, your computer may become unresponsive. Do you want to abort the script?". Why?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Answer:</td>
    <td>I'm doing a bit-o-magic implementing the MHT encoding and decoding purely in javascript. Basically, there's one thread running all the javascript and UI code. The MHT routines are so processor intensive that it might look like the script has hung the browser (as if someone coded an infinite loop, say). If you keep pressing cancel at the prompt, eventually it would finish. To fix this I have one of three choices:
      <ol>
        <li>Mangle the code even more and make liberal use of something called setTimeout</li>
        <li>Find some way to tell the current thread to sleep</li>
        <li>Implement the code in an XPCOM component</li>
      </ol>
    The second solution, if available is the easiest and the third solution is the best. We'll see what happens in the next version.

    <td align="right">Answer:</td>
    <td>It's cross platform, lets you use whatever archive format you want, stores meta-data in XML-based RDF files and integrates almost seamlessly into Mozilla based browsers like Firefox. Hmmm. I don't rightly know. It depends on who you ask.</td>

<h2>Development</h2>

  <tr>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">Answer:</td>
    <td>No-one actually asked this, but I'll answer it anyway. Mozilla's source is a huge download for someone who's still on a 14.4 modem. Heh. That and I recently started playing around with Mozilla based development. This is only my second Mozilla-based project. Also, scripts allow users more control over what archive applications they want to use. Choice is always good.</td>

  <tr>

    <td>What other Mozilla-based projects are you working on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Answer:</td>
    <td>I'm experimenting with XPCOM library development tools. Thus, the FAXP project (nowhere to host it currently - it might end up on sourceforge). Basically it's an ANT-based build of the fastcomponent <a href="http://fastcomponent.mozdev.org/">project</a>. FAXP - Fast Ant XPcom framework. It uses ant-contrib and beanshell to download template files via cvs and fill out the template information. The aim is to make it easily usable across platforms and allow developers to use either the gecko sdk or mozilla source for development.</td>
