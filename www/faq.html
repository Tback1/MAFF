  <tr>
    <td align="right">Question:</td>
    <td>Why use scripts? Why not create an XPCOM component?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Answer:</td>
    <td>No-one actually asked this, but I'll answer it anyway. Mozilla's source is a huge download for someone who's still on a 14.4 modem. Heh. That and I recently started playing around with Mozilla based development. This is only my second Mozilla-based project. Also, scripts allow users more control over what archive applications they want to use. Choice is always good.</td>

    <td>Is this really better than MHT?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Answer:</td>
    <td>It's cross platform, lets you use whatever archive format you want, stores meta-data in XML-based RDF files and integrates almost seamlessly into Mozilla based browsers like Firefox. Hmmm. I don't rightly know. It depends on who you ask.</td>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">Answer:</td>
    <td>This is still beta software, eventually there should only be an XPI and it'll take care of creating the scripts for you using the default Zip format.</td>
