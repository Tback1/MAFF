  <tr>
    <td align="right">Question:</td>
    <td>Why use scripts? Why not create an XPCOM component?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Answer:</td>
    <td>No-one actually asked this, but I'll answer it anyway. Mozilla's source is a huge download for someone who's still on a 14.4 modem. Heh. That and I recently started playing around with Mozilla based development. This is only my second Mozilla-based project. Also, scripts allow users more control over what archive applications they want to use. Choice is always good.</td>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">Question:</td>
    <td>Is this really better than MHT?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Answer:</td>
    <td>It's cross platform, lets you use whatever archive format you want, stores meta-data in XML-based RDF files and integrates almost seamlessly into Mozilla based browsers like Firefox. Hmmm. I don't rightly know. It depends on who you ask.</td>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">Question:</td>
    <td>Why do I have to install an XPI and then other stuff?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Answer:</td>
    <td>This is still beta software, eventually there should only be an XPI and it'll take care of creating the scripts for you using the default Zip format. (Note from 0.2.18, script copying is included in the XPI).</td>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">Question:</td>
    <td>I enabled the windows specific options to run files hidden, but it doesn't work. Why?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Answer:</td>
    <td>First make sure that you have windows scripting installed and working. Make sure the path for the location of WSCRIPT.exe is set properly in the preferences. Also make sure invis.vbs exists and the path to that is set properly. If you move the location of your archive and expand scripts, ensure the directory structure you place them in has no spaces in the directory names.</td>

    <td align="right">Question:</td>
    <td>MAF doesn't save the page content properly. What's going on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Answer:</td>
    <td>MAF uses some (very) mangled code version of the File -> Save as -> Web page Complete code, so if it works properly when not using MAF then I've mangled it too much. If that's the case, eMail the URL you're trying to save to me with a brief description of your browser version, platform and what's not right.</td>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">Question:</td>
    <td>MAF on Mozilla for Windows 2000 and XP just hangs when trying to open or save pages, why?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Answer:</td>
    <td>Not too sure, but it seems that there are some strange permission problems that are created when the scripts are installed. If you can, try moving the MAF script installation to a non-ntfs partition (and modify the scripts accordingly). Alternately, opening the batch files in notepad and saving them back does the trick for some users.</td>
