<!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
<p>The <b><?php echo ucwords($project); ?></b> project is an archive extension that allows complete web pages to be saved in a single archive file. MAF stands for Mozilla Archive Format and the extension uses RDF to save page meta-data such as the original URL of the page and the date/time the page was put in the archive. A <a href="bugs.html">bugs</a> page has been setup for known bugs in the release. Please check there first before reporting any bugs.</p>

<p>MAF 0.7.0 is currently under development and will be compatible with Firefox 1.5 only. This is due to the decreased time I have to spend developing and regression testing on older versions, in different languages, on different platforms. Two of the planned features of the 0.7.0 release include a speed increase in the MHT encoding/decoding and basic <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=office">OpenDocument</a> HTML display support. In the meantime I've released a FF 1.5 compatible release based on the 0.6.x series (0.6.3) as 0.7.0 is taking a very long time to complete.</p>

<p><b>Author:</b> Christopher Ottley.</p>

<p><b>Aim:</b> To provide a Firefox (and Mozilla) extension which allows web pages to be saved easily in an archive.</p>

<p><b>Design:</b> To provide both speed and compatibility, XPCOM components are used to perform the archiving and expansion process. The extension *.MAFF refers to files which can be processed using the default XPCOM zip archive component. External script support via IPC for different formats started to be one big kludge and has been discontinued from the 0.6.x series onwards.</p>

<p><b>Method:</b> An XPCOM component is created that either archives to or expands the contents of the specified MAF archive.</p>

<p><b>Format:</b> Each archive has a list of numbered folders. In each folder is an index.rdf file which holds the meta-data relating the saved page. There is also another index file with the related content type that was saved (index.html if an html page was saved, index.png if a png image was saved etc.). The RDF file holds the name of the index file to use.</p>

<p><b>Tested on:</b>
  <ul>
   <li>FireFox 1.5, Windows 2000/XP/2003.</li>
  </ul>
