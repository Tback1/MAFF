<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<p>Mozilla Archive Format, at the time of each release, is tested and verified
 with the most recent browser versions available in the following release
 channels:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Firefox Beta</b></li>
  <li><b>Firefox Release</b></li>
  <li><b>SeaMonkey Beta</b></li>
  <li><b>SeaMonkey Release</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Testing is done under Windows XP, but the add-on is expected to work on all
 the platforms supported by the browser. Note that the add-on is not expected to
 be compatible with the Nightly channel, though partial compatibility might be
 implemented for the Aurora channel.</p>

<h3>File format compatibility</h3>
<p>MAFF files are standard ZIP files that can be extracted and read with any
 browser and operating system. For an overview of browser support for the MHTML
 format, see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHTML">summary on
 Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<h3>Add-on compatibility</h3>
<p>Mozilla Archive Format is also written to be compatible with the largest
 number of other browser add-ons, with few known exceptions for older or
 unmaintained add-ons. In addition, Mozilla Archive Format is routinely tested
 together with other <a href="documentation.html#extensions">compatible
 extensions</a> on the latest version of Firefox. If you find out a case of
 incompatibility, you can report it through the
 <a href="feedback.html">feedback page.</a></p>

<h2>License and copyright</h2>
<p>The Mozilla Archive Format extension for Firefox has been created by
 Christopher Ottley and is now actively developed by Paolo Amadini. Mozilla
 Archive Format also includes code from the Save Complete extension, created by
 Stephen Augenstein. The latest version of the add-on is available under a
 <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/">MPL 1.1+, GPL 2.0+, LGPL 2.1+</a>
 disjunctive tri-license. Previous versions of the add-on and individual source
 files may be available under different Open Source licenses. See the
 <a href="source.html">source code</a> for more information.</p>

<h2><a name="whatsnew"></a>What's new in the latest version?</h2>
<p>MAF <?php echo ($maf_experimental_fx ? $maf_experimental_fx :
 $maf_latest_fx); ?> has the following user-visible improvements over MAF
 <?php echo $maf_previous_fx; ?>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improved compactness when saving complete web pages:
    <ul>
      <li>Stylesheet rules that don't apply to any element in the current page
       are now removed from the saved file. This can greatly increase
       compactness when content is modified by scripts or other extensions
       before saving.</li>
      <li>The option to take an exact snapshot of the page is now selected by
       default, to take advantage of various improvements in the save method,
       even if it was deselected in a previous version of the add-on. The
       browser's standard save system and the integrated Save Complete component
       can still be selected from the options dialog and the internal
       configuration settings respectively.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The notification bar with information about the original save date and
   location can now be disabled from the options.</li>
  <li>Now file associations on Windows are created correctly when using the
   add-on in third-party browsers based on Firefox or SeaMonkey.</li>
  <li>Removed elements:
    <ul>
      <li>The option to display an archive information icon in the status bar is
       not available anymore, together with the option to display the icon in
       the location bar at all times. The icon can only be displayed in the
       location bar when an archived page is opened.</li>
      <li>The creation of MHTML files that are fully compatible with other
       browsers cannot be explicitly disabled anymore. All the generated MHTML
       files are now fully compatible, as long as the option to take an exact
       snapshot of the page is selected.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

 version?</a></p>
<h2>Known issues</h2>
<p>MAF <?php echo ($maf_experimental_fx ? $maf_experimental_fx :
 $maf_latest_fx); ?> has the following known issues:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In order to open MHTML files when the
   <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/1419">IE Tab</a> extension
   is installed, the filter <tt>/^file:\/\/\/.*\.(mht|mhtml)$/</tt> must be
   disabled from the IE Tab options.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/25">Download
   Sort</a> extension has a known incompatibility with MAF. The conflict cannot
   be resolved without proper modifications to both extensions, and Download
   Sort is not actively maintained at this time.</li>
  <li>The integrated
   <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4723">Save Complete</a>
   extension cannot always save pages with dynamic contents correctly.</li>
  <li>When saving multiple tabs in an archive, the save operation fails if the
   tabs are closed before the operation is completed.</li>
  <li>When saving a page in an archive fails, retrying the download from the
   <b>Downloads</b> window does not achieve the expected result.</li>
  <li>Opening very long documents contained inside MHTML files may cause the
   browser to stop responding temporarily.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Previous versions and source code</h2>
<p>You can download all the previous versions of MAF from the
 <a href="https://www.mozdev.org/projects/overview/maf/">project page</a>. The
 <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a> for all the old versions is also
 available. Source code for the released versions can be found in the XPI
 installation files, and can be read using any ZIP extractor. Source code for
 the development versions of MAF can be accessed from the
 <a href="source.html">source code page</a>.
