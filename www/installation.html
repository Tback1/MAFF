<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<p>Mozilla Archive Format, at the time of each release, is tested and verified
 with the most recent browser versions available in the following release
 channels:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Firefox Beta</b></li>
  <li><b>Firefox Release</b></li>
  <li><b>SeaMonkey Beta</b></li>
  <li><b>SeaMonkey Release</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Testing is done under Windows XP, but the add-on is expected to work on all
 the platforms supported by the browser. Note that the add-on is not expected to
 be compatible with the Nightly channel, though partial compatibility might be
 implemented for the Aurora channel.</p>

<h3>File format compatibility</h3>
<p>MAFF files are standard ZIP files that can be extracted and read with any
 browser and operating system. For an overview of browser support for the MHTML
 format, see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHTML">summary on
 Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<h3>Add-on compatibility</h3>
<p>Mozilla Archive Format is also written to be compatible with the largest
 number of other browser add-ons, with few known exceptions for older or
 unmaintained add-ons. In addition, Mozilla Archive Format is routinely tested
 together with other <a href="documentation.html#extensions">compatible
 extensions</a> on the latest version of Firefox. If you find out a case of
 incompatibility, you can report it through the
 <a href="feedback.html">feedback page.</a></p>

<h2>License and copyright</h2>
<p>The Mozilla Archive Format extension for Firefox has been created by
 Christopher Ottley and is now actively developed by Paolo Amadini. Mozilla
 Archive Format also includes code from the Save Complete extension, created by
 Stephen Augenstein. The latest version of the add-on is available under a
 <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/">MPL 1.1+, GPL 2.0+, LGPL 2.1+</a>
 disjunctive tri-license. Previous versions of the add-on and individual source
 files may be available under different Open Source licenses. See the
 <a href="source.html">source code</a> for more information.</p>

<h2><a name="whatsnew"></a>What's new in the latest version?</h2>
<p>The following improvements are currently available in the Beta Channel:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When multi-process Firefox is enabled, compatibility information is
   displayed in English in the main pane of the options dialog, and the dialog
   is shown automatically the first time this condition is detected.</li>
  <li>Partial compatibility with multi-process Firefox:
    <ul>
      <li>Full support for displaying the contents of web archives.</li>
      <li>The notification bar with information about the original save date and
       location is not displayed when multi-process Firefox is enabled.</li>
      <li>Web archives cannot be created when multi-process Firefox is enabled,
       however it is now possible to use the browser's standard save system to
       save complete web pages in multiple files, without disabling the add-on
       first.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Several features have been removed or redesigned in preparation for full
   compatibility with multi-process Firefox:
    <ul>
      <li>Taking an exact snapshot of the page is now required to create web
       archives, and the browser's standard save system can only be used to save
       complete web pages in multiple files. All the generated MHTML files are
       now fully compatible with other browsers, since the option to create
       partially compatible archives using the browser's standard save system is
       not available anymore.</li>
      <li>The separate Archives dialog has been removed.</li>
      <li>The integrated Save Complete component has been removed.</li>
      <li>The existing integration with the page context menu, the Tools menu,
       and the application menu of older versions of Firefox has been removed in
       favor of the integration with the customizable menu button.</li>
      <li>The preference to use the page title instead of the default suggested
       file name in the "Save As" dialog has been removed since this is now the
       default naming strategy in Firefox.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="changelog.html#whatwasnew">What was new in the previous
 version?</a></p>
<h2>Known issues</h2>
<p>The latest version has the following known issues:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In order to open MHTML files when the
   <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/1419">IE Tab</a> extension
   is installed, the filter <tt>/^file:\/\/\/.*\.(mht|mhtml)$/</tt> must be
   disabled from the IE Tab options.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/25">Download
   Sort</a> extension has a known incompatibility with MAF. The conflict cannot
   be resolved without proper modifications to both extensions, and Download
   Sort is not actively maintained at this time.</li>
  <li>When saving multiple tabs in an archive, the save operation fails if the
   tabs are closed before the operation is completed.</li>
  <li>When saving a page in an archive fails, retrying the download from the
   <b>Downloads</b> window does not achieve the expected result.</li>
  <li>Opening very long documents contained inside MHTML files may cause the
   browser to stop responding temporarily.</li>
</ul>
