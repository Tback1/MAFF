<h5 class="page-header"><a id="content" name="content">Installation</a></h5>

<p>Below you will find links to the latest XPI installer package. The installer packages have been merged so there is one XPI for both Linux and Windows installations. If you have previously installed MAF in Mozilla, please uninstall MAF and then install the latest package.</p>

<p>Latest XPI - <a href="http://downloads.mozdev.org/maf/maf-0.4.2.xpi">0.4.2 for Linux and Windows</a></p>

<p>Please note, if you have previously installed MAF and are installing the 0.3.0 version or higher, the location of scripts and some settings have changed. In order to use the new scripts, go to the <a href="preferences.html">preferences</a>, click on the "Load defaults" button and save the new preferences.</p>

<p>The XPI also sets up the scripts that would be used to perform the actual archiving. This only has to be done once. This is not done if a platform independent upgrade is used. After this is done, the preferences for the MAF extension should be set. MAF is configured by default to work with Infozip's Zip and Unzip programs.</p>

<p>After MAF has been setup, complete the configuration by checking the <a href="preferences.html">preferences</a>.</p>

<p>Previous XPI - <a href="http://downloads.mozdev.org/maf/maf-linux-0.3.0.xpi">0.3.0 for Linux</a></p>

<p>Previous XPI - <a href="http://downloads.mozdev.org/maf/maf-windows-0.3.0.xpi">0.3.0 for Windows</a></p>
