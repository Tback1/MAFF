  <p class="maf-download-afterbox">The latest version of MAF is compatible only
   with <b>Firefox 3</b>. MAF is still available for older versions of Firefox,
   but only the latest version will receive improvements, bugfixes and support
   from the project maintainers.</p>
  <p>This release has been tested with Firefox 3.0.1 on Windows XP, but is
   expected to work on all the platforms supported by Firefox 3.</p>

  <h2>License and copyrights</h2>
  <p>The MAF extension for Firefox has been created by Christopher Ottley and is
   now actively developed by Paolo Amadini. The extension is available under the
   <a href="license.html">GNU General Public License, version 2</a>. Individual
   source files found in the MAF extension may be available under other Open
   Source licenses as well. See the <a href="source.html">source code</a> for
   more information.</p>

  <h2>What's new in the latest version?</h2>
  <p>MAF <?php echo $maf_latest_fx; ?> has the following user-visible
   improvements over MAF 0.6.3:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Compatibility with Firefox 3 on all operating systems.</li>
    <li>Clean installation and uninstallation.</li>
    <li>Redesigned preferences user interface.</li>
    <li>Temporary files are now created in the system's temporary folder by
     default.</li>
    <li>Creating file associations on Windows works again.</li>
    <li>Stabilized file extension and type handling:
      <ul>
        <li>Handle only the <code class="maf-file-ext">.maff</code> extension,
         and not its variations, since double extensions cannot be handled
         correctly by Firefox.</li>
        <li>Removed support for the old <code
         class="maf-file-ext">.maf</code> and <code
         class="maf-file-ext">.maff.zip</code> extensions.</li>
        <li>Added support for <code class="maf-file-ext">.mhtml</code> file
         extension for MHTML archives.</li>
        <li>MAF does not register applications for its MIME types anymore.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Removed features:
      <ul>
        <li><code>maf:</code> protocol (use <code>jar:</code> instead).</li>
        <li><code>document.write</code> override.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Bugfixes:
      <ul>
        <li>Opening archives from the command-line or by double-clicking a file
         when no browser windows are visible now works reliably.</li>
        <li>Now the save functions always overwrite the contents of existing
         archives, rather than appending.</li>
        <li>Copying archive metadata to the clipboard works again.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
