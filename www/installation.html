<p>Below you will find links to the latest XPI installer packages. If this is your first time installing MAF select a operating system specific package. If you have previously installed MAF and there is an XPI upgrade available, then install the upgrade. If you have previously installed MAF but there is no XPI upgrade for your version, please uninstall MAF and then install the latest operating system specific package.</p>

<p>Latest XPI - <a href="http://downloads.mozdev.org/maf/maf-linux-0.3.0.xpi">0.3.0 for Linux</a></p>

<p>Latest XPI - <a href="http://downloads.mozdev.org/maf/maf-windows-0.3.0.xpi">0.3.0 for Windows</a></p>

<!-- p>Latest XPI Upgrade - <a href="http://downloads.mozdev.org/maf/maf-0.3.1.xpi">from 0.3.0 to 0.3.1 platform independent</a></p -->

<p>Please note, if you have previously installed MAF and are installing the 0.3.0 version, the location of scripts and some settings have changed. In order to use the new scripts, go to the <a href="preferences.html">preferences</a>, click on the "Load defaults" button and save the new preferences.</p>

<p>The XPI also sets up the scripts that would be used to perform the actual archiving. This only has to be done once. This is not done if a platform independent upgrade is used. After this is done, the preferences for the MAF extension should be set. MAF is configured by default to work with Infozip's Zip and Unzip programs.</p>

<p>After MAF has been setup, complete the configuration by checking the <a href="preferences.html">preferences</a>.</p>
