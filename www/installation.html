<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<p>Before release, the latest version is tested on the following compatible
 browser versions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Firefox 3.0</b> - <b>3.5</b> - <b>3.6</b></li>
  <li><b>SeaMonkey 2.0</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Testing is done under Windows XP, but the add-on is expected to work on all
 the platforms supported by the browser. Note that the add-on is only declared
 compatible with versions of Firefox and SeaMonkey on which it is actually
 tested, thus excluding nightly builds or alpha versions of the browser. Users
 that would like to experiment with using the add-on on nightly builds should
 override the compatibility declarations using
 <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/6543/">Nightly Tester Tools</a>.</p>

<h3>File format compatibility</h3>
<p>MAFF files are standard ZIP files that can be extracted and read with any
 browser and operating system. For an overview of browser support for the MHTML
 format, see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHTML">summary on
 Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<h3>Add-on compatibility</h3>
<p>Mozilla Archive Format is also written to be compatible with the largest
 number of other browser add-ons, with few known exceptions for older or
 unmaintained add-ons. In addition, Mozilla Archive Format is routinely tested
 together with other <a href="documentation.html#extensions">compatible
 extensions</a> on the latest version of Firefox. If you find out a case of
 incompatibility, you can report it through the
 <a href="feedback.html">feedback page.</a></p>

<h2>License and copyright</h2>
<p>The Mozilla Archive Format extension for Firefox has been created by
 Christopher Ottley and is now actively developed by Paolo Amadini. Mozilla
 Archive Format also includes code from the Save Complete extension, created by
 Stephen Augenstein. The latest version of the add-on is available under a
 <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/">MPL 1.1+, GPL 2.0+, LGPL 2.1+</a>
 disjunctive tri-license. Previous versions of the add-on and individual source
 files may be available under different Open Source licenses. See the
 <a href="source.html">source code</a> for more information.</p>

<h2><a name="whatsnew"></a>What's new in the latest version?</h2>
<p>MAF <?php echo ($maf_experimental_fx ? $maf_experimental_fx :
 $maf_latest_fx); ?> has the following user-visible improvements over MAF
 <?php echo $maf_previous_fx; ?>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compatibility with the latest beta versions of Firefox 4.0 and
   SeaMonkey 2.1.</li>
  <li>MAFF archives are now generated and read with stricter compliance to
   the <a href="maff-specification.html">MAFF specification</a> draft,
   improving compatibility with other applications.</li>
  <li>Modified user interface elements:
    <ul>
      <li>The welcome dialog has been replaced by a welcome page that is
       opened in a browser tab. On Windows, file associations can be
       controlled directly from the welcome page.</li>
      <li>The MAF menu commands are now accessible from the application menu
       that replaces the menu bar in Firefox 4 on Windows Vista and
       later.</li>
      <li>The MAF save commands do not prompt for the file name anymore when
       the related global preference is set in SeaMonkey.</li>
      <li>The default visibility and layout of the MAF menu items has changed,
       and the <b>Save Page In Archive</b> menu item is visible by default.
       The previous layout can be restored from the preferences dialog.</li>
      <li>The preferences dialog has been simplified, the default
       configuration now covers all the common use cases, and advanced
       settings can be changed only from the <tt>about:config</tt> page.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bugfixes:
    <ul>
      <li>On some operating systems, the default configuration didn't allow
       more than one logged on user at a time to open web archives in a
       reliable way.</li>
      <li>Sometimes the archive information popup displayed the date
       incorrectly for some languages other than English.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

 version?</a></p>
<h2>Known issues</h2>
<p>MAF <?php echo ($maf_experimental_fx ? $maf_experimental_fx :
 $maf_latest_fx); ?> has the following known issues:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In order to open MHTML files when the
   <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/1419">IE Tab</a> extension
   is installed, the filter <tt>/^file:\/\/\/.*\.(mht|mhtml)$/</tt> must be
   disabled from the IE Tab options.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/25">Download
   Sort</a> extension has a known incompatibility with MAF. The conflict cannot
   be resolved without proper modifications to both extensions, and Download
   Sort is not actively maintained at this time.</li>
  <li>The integrated
   <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4723">Save Complete</a>
   extension cannot always save pages with dynamic contents correctly.</li>
  <li>When saving multiple tabs in an archive, the save operation fails if the
   tabs are closed before the operation is completed.</li>
  <li>When saving a page in an archive fails, retrying the download from the
   <b>Downloads</b> window does not achieve the expected result.</li>
  <li>Opening very long documents contained inside MHTML files may cause the
   browser to stop responding temporarily.</li>
  <li>With versions of Firefox prior to 3.5.3, web archive files must have a
   lowercase file name extension in order to be opened.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can download all the previous versions of MAF from the
 <a href="https://www.mozdev.org/projects/overview/maf/">project page</a>. The
