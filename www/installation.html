<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<p>Mozilla Archive Format, at the time of each release, is tested and verified
 with the most recent browser versions available in the following release
 channels:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Firefox 3.6</b></li>
  <li><b>Firefox Beta</b></li>
  <li><b>Firefox Release</b></li>
  <li><b>SeaMonkey 2.1</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Testing is done under Windows XP, but the add-on is expected to work on all
 the platforms supported by the browser. Note that the add-on is only declared
 compatible with versions of Firefox and SeaMonkey on which it is actually
 tested, thus excluding the Nightly channel, though partial compatibility might
 be implemented for the Aurora channel. Users that would like to experiment with
 using the add-on on the Nightly or Aurora channels should override the
 compatibility declarations using the
 <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/add-on-compatibility-reporter/">Add-on
 Compatibility Reporter</a>.</p>

<h3>File format compatibility</h3>
<p>MAFF files are standard ZIP files that can be extracted and read with any
 browser and operating system. For an overview of browser support for the MHTML
 format, see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHTML">summary on
 Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<h3>Add-on compatibility</h3>
<p>Mozilla Archive Format is also written to be compatible with the largest
 number of other browser add-ons, with few known exceptions for older or
 unmaintained add-ons. In addition, Mozilla Archive Format is routinely tested
 together with other <a href="documentation.html#extensions">compatible
 extensions</a> on the latest version of Firefox. If you find out a case of
 incompatibility, you can report it through the
 <a href="feedback.html">feedback page.</a></p>

<h2>License and copyright</h2>
<p>The Mozilla Archive Format extension for Firefox has been created by
 Christopher Ottley and is now actively developed by Paolo Amadini. Mozilla
 Archive Format also includes code from the Save Complete extension, created by
 Stephen Augenstein. The latest version of the add-on is available under a
 <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/">MPL 1.1+, GPL 2.0+, LGPL 2.1+</a>
 disjunctive tri-license. Previous versions of the add-on and individual source
 files may be available under different Open Source licenses. See the
 <a href="source.html">source code</a> for more information.</p>

<h2><a name="whatsnew"></a>What's new in the latest version?</h2>
<p>MAF <?php echo ($maf_experimental_fx ? $maf_experimental_fx :
 $maf_latest_fx); ?> has the following user-visible improvements over MAF
 <?php echo $maf_previous_fx; ?>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Greatly improved performance, accuracy and compactness when the option to
   take a faithful snapshot of the page is selected:
    <ul>
      <li>Pages are saved instantly, because hidden content that is not needed
       to display the current state of the page is not downloaded anymore.</li>
      <li>Saved pages can be much smaller, since they do not include unneeded
       content.</li>
      <li>Saved pages can be displayed more accurately, because now scripts
       specified using event attributes or "javascript:" URIs are also removed,
       making sure that they cannot modify the page structure when it is opened
       later.</li>
      <li>If an image or other support resource is not found, the error page is
       not saved in place of the missing resource anymore.</li>
      <li>Images and other content that could not be saved are not connected to
       their original location anymore, leading to truly offline archives and
       making it possible to verify that all content has been saved.</li>
      <li>Saved MHTML archives can now be previewed correctly in Windows, even
       if they contain text in a language other than English.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A notification bar with information about the original save date and
   location is now displayed for all archived pages.</li>
  <li>Updating to the new version makes sure that all the customized
   <a href="documentation.html#internalsettings">internal configuration
   settings</a> are reset to their default value, resolving problems caused by
   old settings that, starting with version 1.0, could be changed only from the
   <tt>about:config</tt> page. There is usually no need to customize those
   settings anymore.</li>
  <li>Now it is possible to link to a specific section inside an archived page,
   appending a fragment or hash part to the URI of the archived page.</li>
  <li>The integrated
   <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4723">Save Complete</a>
   component is now able to save framesets.</li>
  <li>The Saved Pages Conversion Wizard is now able to recognize complete web
   pages saved using Firefox or SeaMonkey in several languages other than
   English and the current browser language.</li>
  <li>The add-on is no longer tested with Firefox 3.0, Firefox 3.5, and
   SeaMonkey 2.0.</li>
  <li>Bugfixes:
    <ul>
      <li>Some images in MHTML pages didn't appear, if they were referenced
       using the "style" attribute.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

 version?</a></p>
<h2>Known issues</h2>
<p>MAF <?php echo ($maf_experimental_fx ? $maf_experimental_fx :
 $maf_latest_fx); ?> has the following known issues:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In order to open MHTML files when the
   <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/1419">IE Tab</a> extension
   is installed, the filter <tt>/^file:\/\/\/.*\.(mht|mhtml)$/</tt> must be
   disabled from the IE Tab options.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/25">Download
   Sort</a> extension has a known incompatibility with MAF. The conflict cannot
   be resolved without proper modifications to both extensions, and Download
   Sort is not actively maintained at this time.</li>
  <li>The integrated
   <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4723">Save Complete</a>
   extension cannot always save pages with dynamic contents correctly.</li>
  <li>When saving multiple tabs in an archive, the save operation fails if the
   tabs are closed before the operation is completed.</li>
  <li>When saving a page in an archive fails, retrying the download from the
   <b>Downloads</b> window does not achieve the expected result.</li>
  <li>Opening very long documents contained inside MHTML files may cause the
   browser to stop responding temporarily.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Previous versions and source code</h2>
<p>You can download all the previous versions of MAF from the
 <a href="https://www.mozdev.org/projects/overview/maf/">project page</a>. The
 <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a> for all the old versions is also
 available. Source code for the released versions can be found in the XPI
 installation files, and can be read using any ZIP extractor. Source code for
 the development versions of MAF can be accessed from the
 <a href="source.html">source code page</a>.
