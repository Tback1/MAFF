  <p class="maf-download-afterbox">The latest version of MAF is compatible only
   with <b>Firefox 3</b>. MAF is still available for older versions of Firefox,
   but only the latest version will receive improvements, bugfixes and support
   from the project maintainers.</p>
  <p>This release has been tested with Firefox 3.0.1 on Windows XP, but is
   expected to work on all the platforms supported by Firefox 3.</p>

  <h2>License and copyrights</h2>
  <p>The MAF extension for Firefox has been created by Christopher Ottley and is
   now actively developed by Paolo Amadini. The extension is available under the
   <a href="license.html">GNU General Public License, version 2</a>. Individual
   source files found in the MAF extension may be available under other Open
   Source licenses as well. See the <a href="source.html">source code</a> for

  <h2>Previous versions</h2>
  <p>You can download all the previous versions of MAF from the
   <a href="https://www.mozdev.org/projects/overview/maf/">project page on
   Mozdev.org</a>.<br>
  <p>The following are the latest versions available for Firefox 2 and below. If
   you are using an unofficial version of MAF 0.6.3 on Firefox 2, you can now
   install version 0.6.3.1. The functionality is identical, except that MAF will
   be updated to the latest version as soon as Firefox 3 is installed.</p>
  <p><b>Important: these versions are provided as a convenience for Firefox 2
   users and not actively developed anymore.</b></p>
