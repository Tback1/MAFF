<p>Latest XPI Upgrade - <a href="http://downloads.mozdev.org/maf/maf-0.2.20.xpi">from 0.2.19 to 0.2.20 platform independent</a></p>

<p>The XPI also sets up the scripts that would be used to perform the actual archiving. This only has to be done once. This is not done if a platform independent upgrade is used. After this is done, the preferences for the MAF extension should be set. MAF is configured by default to work with Infozip's Zip and Unzip programs.</p>

<p>After the utilities have been setup, complete the configuration by checking the <a href="preferences.html">preferences</a>.</p>
