  <h2 class="page-header">About the MAFF file format</h2>

<p>MAFF files are <b>standard ZIP files</b> containing <b>one or more</b> web
 pages, images, or other downloadable content. Additional information, like the
 orirginal page address, is saved along with the content; this <b>metadata</b>
 allows the browser to open these files intelligently.</p>

<h2>Features of the MAFF file format</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>Store web content in a single file</b></p>
    <p>The various files required to view a saved page as it appeared on-line
     are saved together, and cannot be separated by accident.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Store multiple independent pages in the same archive</b></p>
    <p>For example, Firefox with the MAF extension is able to save all the
     open tabs in a single file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Based on the ordinary ZIP / JAR format</b></p>
    <p>The ZIP format is supported natively on many modern operating systems.
     The contents of MAFF archives can be extracted using any ZIP extractor.
     The single files that are saved along with the main web page can be easily
     separated and inspected, in their original form, while preserving the
     advantages of storing the related content in a single file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>View using the jar: protocol</b></p>
    <p>Even without the MAF extension, Mozilla Firefox is able to display the
     contents of MAFF archives natively, using the jar: protocol.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Store metadata about the saved resources</b></p>
    <p>MAFF archives contain metadata like the original URL the page was saved
     from and the date/time of the save operation. The presence of this
     additional data is indifferent to ordinary ZIP extractors, but for
     example allows the Firefox browser with the MAF extension to perform
     operations like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Opening the original page instead of the archived copy while
       on-line</li>
      <li>Enabling off-line navigation between pages in different archives</li>
      <li>Refreshing the archive contents with the latest on-line version
       <i>(not implemented in MAF at present)</i></li>
      <li>Asking web services like the Internet Archive about how the page
       appeared at the time it was saved <i>(not implemented in MAF at
       present)</i></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Store arbitrary extended metadata</b></p>
    <p>Extended metadata may include the browser's scroll position in the
     page, text zoom level, and more. The MAF extension for Firefox has an
     option to store this kind of data, even though the current version is not
     able to read it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Supported by Open Source products</b></p>
    <p>The MAF extension enables Firefox to handle MAFF archives intelligently.
     MAF is an Open Source product, released under the
     <a href="license.html">GNU General Public License</a>, and as such will
     continue to remain available in the future.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Status</h2>
<p>Full support for the MAFF file format is provided by the following versions
 of the Mozilla Archive Format extension:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Version 0.8.0, for Firefox 3</li>
  <li>Version 0.6.3.1, for Firefox 2 and Mozilla 1.7-1.8</li>
</ul>
<p>The file format supported by these versions is referred to as MAFF version 1.
 Previous versions of the MAF extension may not support all the features
 available in the MAFF file format version 1.</p>

<h2 id="maf-maff-overview">Technical overview</h2>
<p><i>This is not intended to be complete by any means, and is based on the
 reverse engineering of the existing MAF extension.</i></p>

<h3>File extension and type</h3>
<p>MAFF files use the <code class="maf-file-ext">.maff</code> file
 extension. Internally, the MAF extension for Firefox registers the MIME type
 <code class="maf-mime-type">application/x-maff</code> for files with the
 <code class="maf-file-ext">.maff</code> extension, unless there is already
 another MIME type association in the system. However, this MIME type is not
 advertised outside of Firefox, for example when the file type is registered
 with the operating system on Windows.</p>

<h3>ZIP implementation</h3>
<p>MAF uses <code>nsIZipReader</code> and <code>nsIZipWriter</code> from Mozilla
Firefox. Their implementation is based on
<a href="http://www.pkware.com/documents/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT">PKWARE's ZIP
Application Note</a>. File and directory names are stored using UTF-8.</p>

<h3>Directory structure</h3>
<p>The root directory is empty. There is one subdirectory for every saved
 page. Every subdirectory contains a file named <tt>index.rdf</tt>, with the
 metadata, and another file with the main web page that was saved. This file is
 usually named <tt>index</tt>, with a file extension based on the content
 type.</p>

<h3>Metadata</h3>
<p>Information about the archived files is stored using RDF, an XML format
 particularly suited to describe metadata about web resources. The matadata is
 stored using a special MAF XML namespace.</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<p>MAFF version 1 is defined on the basis of the existing implementation. As new
 versions of MAF are released, the description of the file format will be
 updated, to accomodate the new features. The MAFF format will be extended
 while ensuring full interoperability between the circulating versions of
 MAF. This will lead to a more formal definition of MAFF version 2, a superset
 of MAFF version 1.</p>
